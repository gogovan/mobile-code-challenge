# Code Challenge (Mobile)

Welcome to GOGOTECH engineering! We are looking for people who challenge themselves. #DareToVenture

Let's get it started! #NoBullshit

## Design

Here is a design from the designer.

https://scene.zeplin.io/project/5dbbd2e0250b2455f1171518

See if there is any questions on the design. 

If there is any, feel free to post on the [Issues](https://github.com/gogovan/mobile-code-challenge/issues) of this repo.

If no, you can start coding! Feel free to use any tools you think is necessary.

It should not take you more than 8 hours.

Summit your work via emailing us to [our code test email](mailto:code.test.engineering@gogo.tech)

Please summit you work with both of you executable and source code.

We will discuss the work based on:  
1. UI Design implementation.
2. System Design.
3. Testing and validation.

Happy Developing!

## Bonus

- Implement this [animation](https://github.com/gogovan/mobile-code-challenge/blob/master/animation.mp4?raw=true).
- If we want to support more than 2 waypoints, what should we change? (You can just illustrate your ideas)
